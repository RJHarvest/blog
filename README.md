# SiteWrite | A simple blog website made with Next.js

A simple blog application made with Next.js. A typical blogging site needs a good SEO for each article page so Next.js was used rather than React.js for server side rendering to load the html docs for search engine bots to scrape the contents of the website. GraphQL was used for easily fetching the exact amount of data needed. MongoDB was used for simplicity of structuring the data as the data classes do not have many complex relationships between each other and a denormalized dataset can be used.
